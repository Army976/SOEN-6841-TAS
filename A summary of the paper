How should I plan to bring new people up to speed during my projects?

People can change in a project. We need to anticipate staff changes. we need to know how and with whom we can replace them. Estimate expences for this change in or addition to staff. 
Projects grow and have different needs in different stages. The schedule shouldn't be over booked to let us have time and resources to face the issues we might have and solving them properly.
Minimize turnover! Easier to retain team member than to lose the person. Take account the extra budget that we might need.
Integrate new person as soon as we can!
